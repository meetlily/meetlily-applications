# Meetlily Apps

**Meetlily Apps** is a web application built with Next.js, version 13. This project combines the power of Next.js with two additional libraries: Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Meetlily Apps is developed using Next.js, a popular framework for building web applications in React. With Next.js version 13, we take advantage of features like server-side rendering and advanced routing for a high-performance web app.

- **Radix UI Integration**: We've incorporated Radix UI, a collection of low-level UI primitives, into Meetlily Apps. This allows us to create accessible and highly composable custom user interface components, ensuring flexibility and ease of use.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Styling Meetlily Apps is made simple with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It provides a comprehensive set of predefined classes that can be directly applied to HTML elements. Tailwind CSS streamlines styling while maintaining a consistent design.
